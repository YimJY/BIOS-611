  (This set of exercise is mostly taken from R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.)

# Exercise 1

1.  What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```
    
    Answer: The code above is naming the data points as "blue", instead of making the color of data points into blue. To correct this, the code should be `aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue".`
    
    

    ```{r}
    
    ```

2.  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
    (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How
    can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

    Answer: Categorical variables are manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, and class, whereas continuous variables are displ, year, cyl, cty, and hwy. Categorical variables are the ones classified as <chr> and continuous ones are <dbl> and <int>.

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape`. How do
    these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous
    variables? 
    
    Answer: I could map color and size, but for shape, I get an error message saying a continuous variable cannot be mapped to shape. This is because there are not as many shapes available to map each continuous data points. 

    ```{r}

    ```

4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 

    Answer: I mapped drv variable to color and shape aesthetics. It assigns respective colors and shapes to each value of drv variables. 

    ```{r}

    ```

5.  What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
    (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
    
    Answer: Stroke aesthetic modifies the width of the border for the shapes that have a border.

    ```{r}

    ```

6.  What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable 
    name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?  

    Answer: It classifies the data points into points that are or are not <5 and gives different colors on the plot. 

    ```{r}

    ```


# Exercise 2

1.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

    Answer: It splits the original plot into facets, subplots that display subsets of drv and cyl variables. The empty cells mean there is no data point in that specific facet. For example, in this plot, there is no data point that satisfy both drv = 5 and cyl = 4.


    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

    Answer: The first code creates subplots based on each values of drv variable and the second code is based on cyl variable. '.' serves as a place holder to indicate the plot does not need to be divided into subplots in x axis/y axis respectively. 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
    Answer: The advantage is that it is much easier to see the distribution of data for each value of certain variable, whereas the disadvantage is that it is not clear to see the overall distribution and compare among the values of variable. It would be more convenient to use faceting instead of the color aesthetic in the case of larger dataset. 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 3

1.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? 
    A histogram? An area chart?

    Answer: Line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, histogram uses histogram geoms, and area chart uses area geoms.

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

    Answer: I predicted that geom_smooth part of the code will create something like a LOESS line, and it actually did. 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does `show.legend = FALSE` do?  What happens if you remove it?  
    Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

    Answer: When you remove `show.legend = FALSE`, it shows the legend that indicates which color represents which value of drv variable. Showing the legend is the default. I think the author used it to tell the difference between group aesthetic and color aesthetic, as the group aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms. 

    ```{r}

    ```

4.  What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?


    Answer: `se=FALSE` removes the confidence interval.

    ```{r}

    ```

5.  Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() + 
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    ```

    Answer: They look the same. When you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. The first code has global mapping and the second code has local mappings for each geom functions, resulting in the same plot as the first one. 

    ```{r}

    ```

6.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
    
    ![Smooth lines for each `drv`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306A.png?raw=true"`)
    
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
      geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
    ```


    ![A single smooth line, transparency by `year`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306B.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv, alpha = year)) +
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

    
    ![Layered dots and an additional text information](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306C.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Adding texts was not covered in class, but give it a try!
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = drv) +
      geom_point(color = "white", shape = 21, stroke = 2)
    ```

# Exercise 4

1.  What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could
    you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the 
    stat function?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control
    its behaviour?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 5

1.  What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 6

1.  Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using `coord_polar()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city
    and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does 
    `geom_abline()` do?
    
    ```{r, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%"}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline() +
      coord_fixed()
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```
